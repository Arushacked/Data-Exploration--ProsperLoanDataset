# Data-Exploration--ProsperLoanDataset
In this I have done the data cleaning and exploration on Prosper Loan Dataset!
# Analysis of Prosper Loan Dataset

Dataset:
The Dataset consists of information regarding various factors and variables in Loans given by Prosper Loans from year 2006 to 2014.
Dataset can be found [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&sa=D&ust=1554486256021000)

It contains 81 variables and 113,979 observation for each loan list data during 2006 to 2014, which can be roughly classified by four kinds of variable categories,i.e,Borrower Data,Loan Data, Credit Risk Metrics, Loan Status.

# Summary of Findings:

I found some really interesting features and relationships between variables. Some of them were quite expected such as relationship between Borrower's APR and Prosper Score .But some of them unexpected as well such as no relationship between Credit Score Range Upper and Prosper score.
Most of the cancelled loans were from year 2006 which might suggest that Cancellation of loans was quite common in earlier times.
Also there was a sudden decrease in Loans in year 2009 due to some economic factor.
Similarly there was a sudden decrease in year 2014. There was a very small positive correlation between Loan Original Amount and Stated Monthly Income which suggests that people with higher income tends to take bigger loans which is some is somewhat self-eplanatory. 
I also got some insights about the Monthly Stated income of the people which normally distributed peaked around 4000,5000.

## Key Insights for Presentation:

For the presentation , I focus on the various types of relationships between different variables and how they affect the Borrower's APR . I also tried to to show the number of loans corresponding to diffeerent Borrowers's category and different year using varoius types of clear plots.
